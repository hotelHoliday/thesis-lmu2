The lolly machine is a demonstrating unit for the Murdoch University School of Engineering that sorts Allen's Kool Fruits\textsuperscript{TM} by colour. The intended purpose of the lolly machine is to showcase the capabilities of Industrial Computer Systems Engineering students. At this present time, the lolly machine is inoperable and in desperate need of an upgrade. 

The project plan contained in this document will outline the necessary actions required to upgrade the lolly machine to a state that is ready for demonstration while surpassing the functionality of the current design.

This document details the project plan of what has been affectionately named \textbf{The Lolly Machine Upgrade 2}, hereafter referred to as the LMU2.
