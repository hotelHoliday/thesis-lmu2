Lolly Machine Upgrade 2 (LMU2)

This is my thesis from my Electrical Engineering Bachelor. 
The aim of this project was to take an old lolly colour sorting machine and upgrade the control hardware/ software to something more inline with todays technology.
This is the second time the lolly machine has been upgraded - hence the 2 in the title.
