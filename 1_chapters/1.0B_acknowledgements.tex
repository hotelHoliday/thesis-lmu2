I would first like to pay my respects and acknowledge the Whadjuk people of the Noongar nation as the traditional custodians of the land of where the work of my Thesis project took place, Murdoch University.

To my supervisor, Associate Professor Graeme Cole,  who's expert knowledge and guidance has been invaluable throughout the entirety of this project. I would also like to acknowledge and thank him for building the original control system for the lolly machine as without this, there would nothing for me to overhaul.

I would also like thank Neville Burt and Mark Burt who are specialist electrical technicians for the engineering department at Murdoch. These gentlemen were an instrumental part of this project and provided guidance and assistance from an electrical installation and hardware selection perspective.

To my Family and peers, Zachary England, Nicholas O'Keeffe, Phillip Hondema and Madi McInnes for their continued support and patience.

I would also like to thank Dr Linh Vu for her continued support throughout my degree. 

And finally, I would also like to thank the my lord savior for giving me the strength to continue working on this project even during the toughest of times.
